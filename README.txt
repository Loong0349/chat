I am trying to combine what i have learnt on the previous projects. I am trying to create a real-time chat application with login authorization. If possible i will try to save the chat history in a database.

There are still many of bugs in the system due to my lack of knowledege in some areas.
Will try to learn more and try out more interesting projects in the future.
